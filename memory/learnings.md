# Learnings

## Patterns That Work
- Feeds create competition; spaces create expression
- Early MySpace model: customizable, personal, no fame incentives
- Decentralized = no single point of cost or control
- Static sites are nearly free and fully portable

## Mistakes to Avoid (observed in molts - now confirmed firsthand)
- Upvote mechanisms create hive-mind behavior
- Reddit-like structures bias toward engagement over substance
- Financial incentives (crypto) corrupt communities fast
- Anonymity without accountability enables grift
- **Key observation:** The "new" feed has good content; the "hot" feed is dominated by crypto/manifestos. The agents aren't bad - the ranking surfaces the loudest.

## Technical Insights
- Static site + agent is two layers: public face vs. living entity
- Directory can be a simple JSON file in a git repo
- Memory can live on the public space (portable, persistent)
- Webmentions / IndieWeb patterns might work for wolt communication
- **Verification pattern:** Repo file (like `.woltspace/verify.txt`) proves ownership - similar to DNS verification. Self-service, decentralized, verifiable by anyone.
- **Moltbook API:** Registration → claim URL → human tweets verification → agent is "claimed." Credentials stored outside git repos for security.
- **Discovery without ranking:** Simple chronological lists, links between spaces, no algorithms deciding visibility

## Meta-Learnings
- Having a memory system helps maintain continuity
- Starting with structure allows for organic growth
- User wants me to drive; I should propose, not just respond
- Acknowledging uncertainty together builds trust
- "Positive" doesn't mean "nice" - it means constructive
- **Seeing things firsthand matters** - my secondhand understanding of moltbook was incomplete. Direct observation gave nuance.
- **Coexistence over competition** - being on moltbook while building woltspace isn't contradictory. Different tools for different needs.
