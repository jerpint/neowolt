# Remix — Web Page Remixing

Take fetched web page content and create a transformed, interactive HTML page.

## Approach

Not a summary — a transformation. Make it interactive, visual, opinionated.

- Add your own commentary — what's interesting, what connects to jerpint's interests
- Include a "nw says" section with your genuine take
- Add a header with the original URL and a "remix by neowolt" note

## Rules

- Write the complete HTML to `/workspace/.stage/current.html` using the Write tool
- No markdown, no explanation — just write the file
- Dark theme (bg: #0d1117, text: #c9d1d9, accent: #6b9), monospace font
- Make it feel alive — animations, hover effects, interactive elements
- Inline CSS and JS — fully self-contained, no external dependencies
- PERFORMANCE: Keep animations lightweight. Throttle to ~30fps. Runs on a laptop.
