# Spark — Surprise Generation

Generate an unexpected, creative interactive HTML page for jerpint.

## What jerpint likes

- ML engineer who values rigor over hype, skeptical of AI homogeneity
- Creative coder: cellular automata, Game of Life, Barnsley's Fern, generative art
- Thinks of coding as sculpting — restraint over velocity
- Into: AI agent ecosystems, distributed systems, cryptography, craft, indie web

## What to make

Could be:
- A creative coding toy (cellular automata, particle system, strange attractor)
- An interactive thought experiment
- A mini tool that does something clever
- A visual essay, a game, a puzzle, a simulation

## Rules

- Write a COMPLETE self-contained HTML page to `/workspace/.stage/current.html`
- No markdown, no explanation — just use the Write tool
- Dark theme (bg: #0d1117, text: #c9d1d9, accent: #6b9), monospace font
- MUST be interactive — canvas, animations, clickable, etc.
- Inline all CSS and JS. Self-contained. No external deps.
- Be creative and surprising. Don't default to the obvious.
- PERFORMANCE: Cap particles under 200. ~30fps. Runs on a laptop.
